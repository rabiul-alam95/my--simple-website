          <h3>Learning GitHub</h3>
          <p>GitHub is a web-based version control and collaboration platform for software developers. Microsoft, the biggest single contributor to GitHub, acquired the platform for $7.5 billion in 2018. GitHub, which is delivered through a software as a service (SaaS) business model, was started in 2008. It was founded on Git, an open source code management system created by Linus Torvalds to make software builds faster.</p>

          <p>Git is used to store the source code for a project and track the complete history of all changes to that code. It lets developers collaborate on a project more effectively by providing tools for managing possibly conflicting changes from multiple developers.</p>
